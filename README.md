# Summit
Summit is an RPG-style game demo that I made as part of my Dissertation for my Computer Science undergraduate course at the University of Loughborough, during the 2024-2025 academic year. It is my first attempt at making a complete gameplay loop using the Godot engine. I used Godot version 4.2.1 to make up to version 0.1.8_1 of Summit.

Summit features a rudimentary fishing and combat system, as well as 2 example quests.
