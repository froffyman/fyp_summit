# Summit
Summit is an RPG-style game demo that I made as part of my Dissertation for my Computer Science undergraduate course at the University of Loughborough, during the 2024-2025 academic year. It is my first attempt at making a complete gameplay loop using the Godot engine. I am currently using Godot version 4.2.1 to develop Summit, though may upgrade later on.

Summit features a rudimentary fishing and combat system, as well as 2 example quests.

Important note: The huge JavaScript content just comes from exported builds of the game meant for the web.
